Covid: China rejects WHO plan for second phase of virus origin probe

China has rejected the next stage of a World Health Organization (WHO) plan to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.The WHO
wants to audit laboratories in the area where the virus was first identified. But Zeng Yixin, deputy health minister, said this
showed "disrespect for common sense and arrogance toward science". WHO experts said it was very unlikely the virus escaped from a Chinese lab,
but the theory has endured. Investigators were able to visit Wuhan - the city where the virus was first detected in December 2019 - in January of this year.
