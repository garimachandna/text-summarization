The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme in Africa: clarifying misperceptions


Extensive testing in clinical trials has confirmed that the malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, reduces malaria significantly, including life-threatening severe malaria. Modeling studies suggests that, if introduced widely, the vaccine could save tens of thousands of lives per year. The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) is now underway to (i) support the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01 by routine health systems, and (ii) evaluate the routine use of the vaccine. In recent days, it has become clear that the distinction between these 2 sets of activities is not always recognized, and this has caused some confusion. Here we aim to clarify these – and some related – key points.
