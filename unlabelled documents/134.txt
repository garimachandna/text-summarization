COVID-19 pandemic not over, says expert, on Omicron emergence

Virus can keep acquiring mutations that may be more or less detrimental, says G. Padmanaban of BIRAC
In the wake of the emergence of new coronavirus variant Omicron , persons with co-morbidities and the older age group need to be monitored and, in general, the vaccination of children is the next agenda and India should plan for a booster vaccine dose in the second half of 2022, although two-dose vaccination of the target population is still the priority, said Professor G. Padmanaban (IISc, Bengaluru), senior science innovation adviser, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Department of Biotechnology, in an interview.
