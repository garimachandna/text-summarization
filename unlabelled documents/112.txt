COVID-19 and the world of work

The world of work has been profoundly affected by the global virus pandemic. In addition to the threat to public health,
the economic and social disruption threatens the long-term livelihoods and wellbeing of millions. Virtually gathered at the 109th
International Labour Conference, ILO's constituents – Governments, workers and employers – have adopted a Global Call to action for
a human-centred recovery from the COVID-19 crisis that is inclusive, sustainable and resilient.
