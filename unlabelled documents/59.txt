WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 30 November 2020

Last week saw the first decline in newly-reported cases globally since September. 
This is no time for complacency, especially with the holiday season approaching in many cultures and countries. 
The COVID-19 pandemic will change the way we celebrate, but it doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate. The changes you make will depend on where you live. 
Always follow your local or national guidelines. 
Tomorrow is World AIDS Day. New HIV infections have declined by 23% since 2010, and AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 39%.
A record 26 million people are on antiretroviral treatment – but the pace of increase has slowed, and that leaves 12 million people who are living with HIV but are not on treatment. 
That gap is jeopardising our goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.
