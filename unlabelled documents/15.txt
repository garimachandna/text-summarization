CND accepts all WHO recommendations on the control of several psychoactive substances from the 42nd ECDD meeting


During its 63rd session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) accepted all recommendations from the 42nd meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD). This effectively brings twelve psychoactive substances, including eleven New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and one medicine, under international control.  Given the potential for dependence or abuse and known adverse effects, these compounds pose a risk to public health and society and are largely without any therapeutic benefit. Based on an in-depth review of candidate compounds by the ECDD, an independent group of experts in the field of drugs and medicines, the WHO provides annual recommendations on substance scheduling to the CND, a policy-making body comprised of 53 UN Member States. This ECDD review includes a balanced consideration of potential for abuse, dependence and harm with therapeutic value. The CND then votes on whether or not the WHO recommendations for placing reviewed substances under international control should be endorsed.
