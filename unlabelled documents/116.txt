COVID-19 pandemic leads to major backsliding on childhood vaccinations, new WHO, UNICEF data shows 

23 million children missed out on basic vaccines through routine immunization services in 2020 – 3.7 million more than in
2019 - according to official data published today by WHO and UNICEF. This latest set of comprehensive worldwide childhood 
immunization figures, the first official figures to reflect global service disruptions due to COVID-19,  show a majority of
countries last year experienced drops in childhood vaccination rates. Concerningly, most of these – up to 17 million children
– likely did not receive a single vaccine during the year, widening already immense inequities in vaccine access. Most of these
children live in communities affected by conflict, in under-served remote places, or in informal or slum settings where they face
multiple deprivations including limited access to basic health and key social services.
