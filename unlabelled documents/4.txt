Eliminating visceral leishmaniasis: India takes decisive steps to overcome last-mile challenges

India recently carried out a high-level independent mission to assess and evaluate its national visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) strategy. The aim of the independent assessment mission is to identify existing gaps and measure the country’s performance in implementing programmes to achieve the elimination of the disease as a public health problem. “Challenges need to be identified as we resolutely move towards eliminating kala-azar,” said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India. “The importance of an inclusive, pro-poor strategy cannot be underscored as the disease affects marginalized communities. We are confident that this independent assessment by experts will guide the national programme to address remaining bottlenecks.” The first agreement2 to eliminate kala-azar was initiated in 2005 when India, Bangladesh and Nepal, signed the trilateral Memorandum of Understanding. The number of annual reported cases has since decreased from 32, 803 to 3128 in 2019, representing a 90% drop.
