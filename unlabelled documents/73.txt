India is a day away from beginning what will be the world's largest vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), on January 16. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the immunisation drive in India, where authorities have given emergency use authorisation (EUA) to two vaccines: Oxford University-AstraZeneca's Covishield, and Hyderababd-based Bharat Biotech International Limited's Covaxin. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) will manufacture Covishield here.
