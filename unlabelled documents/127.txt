Covid-19: 5 steps to avoid Omicron, 10 to take immediately


South Africa reacted with outrage to travel bans, first triggered by the United Kingdom (UK), imposed on it in the wake of the news that its genomics surveillance team had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa has been monitoring changes in SARS-CoV-2 since the pandemic first broke out.

The new variant â€“ identified as B.1.1.529 has been declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation and assigned the name Omicron.

The mutations identified in Omicron provide theoretical concerns that the variant could be slightly more transmissible than the Delta variant and have reduced sensitivity to antibody activity induced by past infection or vaccines compared to how well the antibody neutralises ancestry virus.
