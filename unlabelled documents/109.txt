Different types of COVID-19 vaccines: How they work

A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine can prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying
due to COVID-19. But how do the different types of COVID-19 vaccines work? Each COVID-19 vaccine causes the immune system to
create antibodies to fight COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines use a harmless version of a spikelike structure on the surface of the
COVID-19 virus called an S protein.
