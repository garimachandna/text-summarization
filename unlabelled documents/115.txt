The W.H.O. urges wealthy countries to halt booster shots and send more doses to poorer nations.

The World Health Organization called on Wednesday for a moratorium on coronavirus vaccine booster shots until the end of September,
so that vaccine supplies can be focused on helping all countries vaccinate at least 10 percent of their populations. The agency made
its appeal to the world’s wealthiest nations to address the wide disparities in vaccination rates around the world. “I understand the 
concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the W.H.O., 
said in a briefing. “But we cannot — and we should not — accept countries that have already used most of the global supply  of vaccines 
using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.”
