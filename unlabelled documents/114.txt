Tocilizumab, second drug ever recommended by WHO for COVID-19, will remain unaffordable and inaccessible for most of the world

As the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended tocilizumab today for people with severe COVID-19, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors
Without Borders (MSF) called on the Swiss pharmaceutical corporation Roche, the world’s sole producer of the drug, to lower the price
of the drug to make it affordable and accessible for everyone who needs it, everywhere. Roche must end its monopoly and urgently share
the know-how, master cell lines and technology needed to produce this drug with other manufacturers across the world to ensure supply and
improved access. Tocilizumab is the second drug ever recommended by the WHO for COVID-19 treatment after recommending dexamethasone in September 2020. 
It belongs to the class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), that are used in the treatment of various diseases including cancers.
However, most of the existing mAbs have been priced extremely high, and are hence virtually impossible to access in low- and middle-income countries.
