COVID-19: UN Secretary-General says the world has failed an ethics test


Secretary-General António Guterres today told the United Nations General Assembly that a scientific triumph on COVID-19 vaccines had been undone by “the tragedy of a lack of political will, selfishness and mistrust.”

In his opening speech to the general debate of the General Assembly the Secretary-Generals said that one image told “the tale of our times”.

“The picture we have seen from some parts of the world of COVID-19 vaccines … in the garbage. Expired and unused.  On the one hand, we see the vaccines developed in record time — a victory of science and human ingenuity.

On the other hand, we see that triumph undone by the tragedy of a lack of political will, selfishness and mistrust.

A surplus in some countries. Empty shelves in others.”
