PLOS Medicine Special Collection on Advances in Clinical Trial Design for Development of New Treatments for TB


A Special Collection on Advances in Clinical Trial Design for Development of New Treatments for Tuberculosis has been released by PLOS Medicine. This Special Collection, that is now complete with the publication of its last paper, contains a series of articles that articulate the essential new steps in clinical research that will pave the way for the development of future optimal treatment for all forms of tuberculosis. The Collection has been sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD-France), and coordinated by Dr Christian Lienhardt, Research Director at IRD-France and Dr Payam Nahid, Professor at University of California, San Francisco, USA.  Development of new TB treatments is very long and costly, and hampered by several methodological limitations. The most commonly touted challenge in TB therapeutics remains the absence of a surrogate marker that can be readily measured and that estimates with adequate certainty the anticipated treatment effect in late stage clinical development. New opportunities are emerging with the recent developments in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics methodologies, novel clinical trial designs, new biomarkers, as well as recent advances in molecular diagnostics. A recently broadened and exciting pipeline of new candidate drugs compels us to revisit our current approaches to TB drug development, and based on the learnings of the last 50 years, to identify and seek consensus on best practices for future TB clinical trial designs.
