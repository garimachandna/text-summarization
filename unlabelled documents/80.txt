COVID-19 third wave may peak in February, say experts 

Health experts believe that due to Omicron's high transmissibility rate, the new COVID-19 variant cases may outpace the surge of the Delta variant that was seen during the second wave earlier this year in the country. According to experts, a likely third coronavirus wave in the country projected to peak in February 2022, will be milder.
