Schistosomiasis elimination: refocusing on snail control to sustain progress



Substantial progress has been made during the past decade to prevent and control schistosomiasis (also known as bilharziasis) globally. The disease affects more than 230 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Progress is mainly due to large-scale periodic treatment of affected populations with praziquantel, the only medicine recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) against all forms of schistosomiasis. Regular treatment cures mild symptoms and prevents progression to severe, chronic disease. “Through progressive scale-up of periodic large-scale treatment to control morbidity in many endemic countries, we are closer to achieving the minimum target of 75% global coverage of all school?aged children,” said Dr Amadou Garba Djirmay, who leads WHO’s global schistosomiasis control programme. “But if we want to achieve elimination, we must go a step further to introduce snail control in hot spots and in areas targeting elimination. This is bound to increase impact and accelerate progress towards interruption of transmission.”
