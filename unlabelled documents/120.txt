ACOG and SMFM Recommend COVID-19 Vaccination for Pregnant Individuals

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), the two leading
organizations representing specialists in obstetric care, recommend that all pregnant individuals be vaccinated against COVID-19. The organizationsâ€™
recommendations in support of vaccination during pregnancy reflect evidence demonstrating the safe use of the COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy from
tens of thousands of reporting individuals over the last several months, as well as the current low vaccination rates and concerning increase in
cases. Data have shown that COVID-19 infection puts pregnant people at increased risk of severe complications and even death; yet only about 22% of
pregnant individuals have received one or more doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
