Covid-19 cases, deaths rise again globally

Covid-19 deaths and cases are on the rise again globally in a dispiriting setback that is triggering another round of restrictions 
and dampening hopes for a return to normal life.The World Health Organization reported Wednesday that deaths climbed last week after
nine straight weeks of decline. It recorded more than 55,000 lives lost, a 3% increase from the week before. Cases rose 10% last week
 to nearly 3 million, with the highest numbers recorded in Brazil, India, Indonesia and Britain, WHO said.The reversal has been attributed
to low vaccination rates, the relaxation of mask rules and other precautions, and the swift spread of the more-contagious delta variant,
which WHO said has now been identified in 111 countries and is expected to become globally dominant in the coming months.
