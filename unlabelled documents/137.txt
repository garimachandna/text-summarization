COVID-19: Europe is back to November 2020 numbers, severe cases higher

Europe once again finds itself in the centre of a resurgence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Several countries have gone into lockdown to contain the fresh surge of cases. 

Daily infections and deaths in the continent are nearly the same as that recorded in November 2020, when Europe was in the middle of its second wave, according to latest projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent population health research centre at University of Washington School of Medicine. 

What is more worrying is that severe cases have gone up this time, as evident from the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) across Europe. 

In November 2020, the requirement for ICU beds was between 25,000 and 42,000. This month, the figure is over 100,000.
