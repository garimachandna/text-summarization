WHO's Covid-19 origin probe 'highly deficient', says Blinken 

The World Health Organization's first phase of study on the origins of COVID-19 pandemic is "highly deficient",
said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday (local time) and added that leaders from the Group of Seven (G7)
countries will insist China to cooperate with a second phase of WHO study. "The World Health Organization, you're right,
the first study they put out was highly deficient," Blinken told Fox News on Sunday, as quoted by the US State Department
press release."The leaders of the G-7 have come together insisting that China to cooperate with the so-called phase two study
by the WHO to really get to the bottom of what happened. But that's not enough." Backing the calls for further probe into the
origin of the virus, Blinken said that "We need to get to the bottom of what happened."
