With COVID-19, World Health Organisation's Fall from Grace Is Complete

In recent decades, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has achieved almost sacred status as a bastion of internationalist
action and development. However, as we outline in our new report – The WHO and Covid-19: Re-establishing Colonialism in Public
Health – this reputation is now dead in the water. Over the past two decades, the WHO has recreated structures of what can only
be described as ‘colonial control’. Now the health priorities of populations at highest need are overridden by the interests of
those who now control much of WHO’s agenda: wealthy countries, corporations and high net-worth individuals.
