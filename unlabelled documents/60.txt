UNICEF calls for averting a lost generation as COVID-19 threatens to cause irreversible harm to childrenâ€™s education, nutrition and well-being

The report finds that, as of 3 November, in 87 countries with age-disaggregated data, children and adolescents under 20 years of age accounted for 1 in 9 of COVID-19 infections, or 11 per cent of the 25.7 million infections reported by these countries. 
More reliable, age-disaggregated data on infection, deaths and testing is needed to better understand how the crisis impacts the most vulnerable children and guide the response.
While children can transmit the virus to each other and to older age groups, there is strong evidence that, with basic safety measures in place, the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them, the report notes. 
Schools are not a main driver of community transmission, and children are more likely to get the virus outside of school settings.
