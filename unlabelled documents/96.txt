Individual and community-based measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Canada
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), in collaboration with Canadian public health experts, has updated this guidance on the use of non-pharmaceutical public health measures (PHM) to mitigate community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The primary audiences for the guidance are federal/provincial/territorial (FPT) and regional/local public health authorities (PHA). In the operationalization of this guidance, it is recognized that each PHA may have unique approaches to implement individual and community-based measures, based on jurisdiction-specific considerations.Principles and concepts outlined in The Canadian pandemic influenza preparedness: Planning guidance for the health sector were used as a foundation in the development of this guidance.
