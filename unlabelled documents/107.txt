Chance That COVID-19 Vaccines Are Gene Therapy? 'Zero'

There are lots of unfounded fears about the COVID-19 vaccines floating around, and one of the most pervasive is the idea that
these new shots aren't really vaccines, but that they will somehow change your genes or insert themselves into the DNA of your cells.
You may see people posting on social media about the vaccines being a kind of gene therapy, and they're partly right, but in the end
this idea often misses some important details about how the vaccines work. They can't change your genes, and they don't stay in your
body for more than a few days.
