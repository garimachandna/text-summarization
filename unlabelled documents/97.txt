EU entry ban exemption categories
An EU entry ban is in effect for people from countries outside the European Union/Schengen area. There are exemptions to the entry ban, for example for people travelling from a safe country or people with proof of vaccination or proof of recovery. This proof of vaccination or recovery must meet certain requirements. From 23 March 2022 people travelling to the Netherlands no longer need to show a negative test result.
