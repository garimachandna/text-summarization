Vaccinating children against COVID not priority from WHO perspective: Vaccines expert

The World Health Organisation’s top vaccines expert says that immunising children against the coronavirus “is not a high priority”
given the extremely limited global supply of vaccines. Dr Kate O’Brien says vaccinating children “is not a priority from a WHO perspective”,
even as increasing numbers of rich countries authorise their COVID-19 shots for teenagers and children. O’Brien says since children are not
typically at risk of getting severely ill or dying from COVID-19, vaccinating them during the pandemic is mostly aimed at stopping transmission,
rather than protecting them from disease.
