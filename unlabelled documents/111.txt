WHO's Covid weapons fight still $16.8 bn short

The World Health Organization's global appeal for funding for coronavirus vaccines, treatments, diagnostics and equipment is still $16.8-billion short
-- almost half its total needs, the WHO said Tuesday. The funding shortfall comes amid a widening gap between rich and poor nations in their ability
to fight the pandemic, with access to vaccines woefully uneven. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sounding an alarm on the gap in access to resources,
warned that the pandemic remained in a "very dangerous phase" more than 18 months in.
