Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Weekly Epidemiological Update (29 December 2020)

Globally in the past week, over 4 million new cases were reported. Although this is a 12% decrease compared to the previous week, this and other short-term trends in data should be interpreted with caution over the end-of-year holiday season, as numbers may be influenced by presentation, testing and reporting delays. New deaths decreased by 8% to 72 730 (Figure 1, Table 1). The Region of the Americas accounts for 48% of all new cases and 42% of all new deaths globally. While new cases and deaths remained high in the European Region, which accounted for 37% and 42% respectively, both decreased compared to the previous week.
