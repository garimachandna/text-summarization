Women's health and rights: 25 years of progress?

The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the world’s most progressive blueprint for advancing gender equality worldwide. Twenty-five years after it was affirmed by 189 countries, what progress has been made in raising this blueprint off the page? On International Women’s Day the World Health Organization, United Nations University - International Institute for Global Health and the British Medical Journal have launched a special series marking ‘Beijing+25’. It shines a spotlight on health, education, environment, work and other critical foundations of life as they empower or restrict the rights and well-being of girls and women.
