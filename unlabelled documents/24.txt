Ending the neglect: inaugural webinar on the new road map, COVID-19 and the road to recovery

COVID-19 is set to change the landscape of global public health, with long-lasting economic and social impacts necessitating changes in approaches to tackling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that may include rethinking resources and programmatic orientation.“WHO’s upcoming road map for neglected tropical diseases for 2021–2030 proposes a new model of operation,” said Dr Mwelecele Malecela, Director, WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. “This road map, with its major shifts, is even more relevant in the context of COVID-19 as it promotes resilience, health system strengthening, community participation, equity, country ownership and enhanced partner involvement through integrated, multisectoral collaboration.”During the inaugural webinar on 17 June, two panels will discuss the shifts needed during post-COVID-19 recovery to achieve the road map targets for 2030.The first panel will consider how the global community can build on and use innovative approaches to sustain the progress made thus far.The second panel will explore how to align and coordinate work with countries and stakeholders, enhance multisectoral coordination to achieve the global targets and examine the role of health workers and volunteers across various interventions.
