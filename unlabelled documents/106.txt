Post-COVID Conditions: Information for Healthcare Providers

Some patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have new, recurring, or ongoing
symptoms and clinical findings four or more weeks after infection, sometimes after initial symptom recovery. Post-COVID
conditions can occur in patients who have had varying degrees of illness during acute infection, including those who had
mild or asymptomatic infections. Medical and research communities are still learning about these post-acute symptoms and
clinical findings.
