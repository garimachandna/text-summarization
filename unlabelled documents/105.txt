COVID variants ‘winning the race against vaccines’ warns WHO chief

During his biweekly conference in Geneva, he added that passing the four millionth recorded death worldwide from COVID-19
was a “tragic milestone” which “likely underestimates the overall toll” of the deadly virus. Tedros warned that far too many
countries are seeing “sharp spikes in cases and hospitalization”, while rich nations with high inoculation rates, were dropping
public health measures “as though the pandemic is already over.”
