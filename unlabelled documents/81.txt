Science Brief: SARS-CoV-2 and Surface (Fomite) Transmission for Indoor Community Environments
CDC continues to learn more about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic. Information in past Science Briefs might not reflect CDC’s current understanding and recommendations. CDC’s Science Briefs summarize the scientific evidence behind specific guidance and recommendations. Each Science Brief captures the scientific evidence and our understanding of it at the time the brief was published.The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is through exposure to respiratory droplets carrying infectious virus. It is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites), but the risk is generally considered to be low.
