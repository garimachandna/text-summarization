Omicron vs Delta: How the two Covid-19 variants are different from each other

Scientists across the world are racing to understand the Omicron variant of Covid-19 that has led to major panic with the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring it a Variant of Concern. While the Omicron variant is speculated to be more dangerous than others, it was the Delta variant that wreaked havoc in several parts of the world, including India, earlier this year.


The WHO said it is coordinating with several researchers worldwide to better understand how the new variant will impact the Covid-19 pandemic, with new findings expected within "days and weeks." Scientists are closely monitoring whether cases caused by the Omicron variant reported on public databases start to supplant those caused by Delta.
