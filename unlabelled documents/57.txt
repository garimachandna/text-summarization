Keep health workers safe to keep patients safe: WHO

The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling on governments and health care leaders to address persistent threats to the health and safety of health workers and patients.
The pandemic has also highlighted the extent to which protecting health workers is key to ensuring a functioning health system and a functioning society.
While health workers represent less than 3% of the population in the large majority of countries and less than 2% in almost all low- and middle-income countries, around 14% of COVID-19 cases reported to WHO are among health workers.
In some countries, the proportion can be as high as 35%.  However, data availability and quality are limited, and it is not possible to establish whether health workers were infected in the work place or in community settings. 
Thousands of health workers infected with COVID-19 have lost their lives worldwide.
