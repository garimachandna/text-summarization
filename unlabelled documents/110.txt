‘Early stages’ of Covid-19 third wave, amid Delta surge: WHO

The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is now in the "early stages" of the third wave, warned World Health Organization
(WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday, even as he sounded a fresh alarm over a global surge in cases of the Delta
variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. “Unfortunately…we are now in the early stages of a third wave”, Ghebreyesus said in an 
address to the emergency committee on Covid-19 established under the International Health Regulations (IHR), a treaty that guides
global response to public health risks.
